\subsection{Configure slave GBTx to use master SCA channel}
This setup is required to program a slave via a master SCA channel.
In a typical scenario, the master is connected to a MiniDAQ so that programming
the slave using the MiniDAQ directly\footnote{
    MiniDAQ $\to$ master GBTx $\to$ slave GBTx.
}is possible.
Follow \autoref{fig:master-sca} to connect a slave GBTx to the SCA channel of a
master GBTx board.

    The black ground cable can be connected to any of the ground pin on the
    master GBTx.
\end{leftbar}

\begin{leftbar}
    There is a custom 2x1 to 2x1 cross-type cable made in-house to replace the
    red-blue connectors.
    To use that cable, make sure the two 2x1 connectors have the same
    orientation (e.g.\ the sides \emph{without} metal contact are both facing
    up).
